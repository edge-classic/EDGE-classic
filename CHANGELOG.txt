CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.34 (since EDGE-Classic 1.33)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------
+ Fixed incorrect height for Doom 2 Thing 53.

+ Fixed autoload folder items paths being prepended with the autoload folder path itself
  (cleanup from prior method of using PATH_Join)
  
+ COAL player.query_weapon() would not return ZOOM FACTOR in some cases.

+ Fixed CVAR value strings with spaces not being processed as intended

+ Migrated cfg file parser to EPI::Lex, fixing a potential buffer overflow in the previous method

+ Fixed -deathmatch startup parameter not being respected


General Improvements
--------------------
+ Changed AJBSP to open loaded IWADs/PWADs in read mode as an additional means of ensuring original file
  integrity (was previously set to open in append mode despite not writing nodes to the original files)

+ Added 'udmf_strict' CVAR (off by default until "Edge" namespace is finalized) to control whether or not loading a UDMF map with an unsupported namespace will generate an error.

+ Draw Distance Culling will no longer prevent the skybox from being drawn; maximum distance is now adjustable in the Performance Options menu

+ Draw Distance Culling's BSP culling math has been reworked and offers far better FPS savings versus the previous method in applicable environments

+ COAL:
  - Color and Hue averaging functions have been reworked to allow for a specific portion of an image to be sampled. Function definitions are now as follows:
    - hud.get_average_color(image : string, optional from_x, optional to_x, optional from_y, optional to_y)
    - hud.get_lightest_color(image : string, optional from_x, optional to_x, optional from_y, optional to_y)
    - hud.get_darkest_color(image : string, optional from_x, optional to_x, optional from_y, optional to_y)
    - hud.get_average_hue(image : string, optional from_x, optional to_x, optional from_y, optional to_y)

+ WEAPONS.DDF:
  - Y_ADJUST parameter will now affect weapons that use models instead of sprites

+ THINGS.DDF:
  - FALLPAIN_SOUND will now account for whether or not the player is invulnerable to damage at the time of the fall

+ New directories, logfiles, etc, will now be written to an appropriate location in the user's home directory by default (AppData, etc, depending on OS). Portable
  usage is covered in "New Features"

+ "PC Speaker Mode" Sound Option no longer requires a restart to toggle; when On it will always use Fluidlite + the Bonkers for Bits soundfont when playing MIDI music

+ For the RTS REPLACE_WEAPON command and the WEAPONS.DDF BECOME() action: If current ammo is bigger than the new clip size, reduce current ammo to new clip size.

+ Stats screen item layout improved so that long map names are not truncated or overlapping level score/stats

+ Bot Skill will now affect bot movement speed, strafing frequency, turn speed, and angle/confidence required to fire on target

New Features
------------
+ Added WebGL platform support

+ Added GLES2 rendering backend using GL4ES (https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es) 

+ UDMF:
  - Vertex slope support: Must define "zfloor" or "zceiling" for a vertex.
  - Applies effects to any triangular sector or rectangular sectors that fulfill the following conditions:
    - Only two out of the four vertices utilize zfloor/zceiling values
    - The two vertices must be part of the same line segment
    - The zfloor value must be identical between the two vertices for a floor slope
    - The zceiling value must be identical between the two vertices for a ceiling slope
    - The floor and ceiling slope for a rectangular sector can use different vertices as long
      as they fulfill the other conditions
	  
+ WEAPONS.DDF: 10 new action commands. Behave identically as the things.ddf actions of the same name
  - ZOOM
  - SET_INVULNERABLE
  - CLEAR_INVULNERABLE
  - MOVE_FWD(num)
  - MOVE_RIGHT(num)
  - MOVE_UP(num)
  - STOP
  - TURN(angle)
  - TURN_RANDOM(angle)
  - MLOOK_TURN(angle)

+ Portable install option
  - If the program is launched with "-portable" or "edge-classic.cfg" is found in the same directory as the program, files and folders will be written
    to that directory instead of a location in the user's home path

+ "Outdoor Culling Fog Color" option added to Performance Options menu
  - Options are "Match Sky", "White", "Grey" and "Black"
  - Default is "Match Sky"

+ Customizable branding options
  - New "branding.cfg" file present in game directory will control values like folder names, window titles, configuration and logging filenames
  - Will default to hardcoded values if file is missing	  
  
+ STYLES.DDF: expanded control over [MAIN_MENU], [CHOOSE_EPISODE] and [CHOOSE_SKILL] menus. 
  Both graphic and text menus now behave coherently (i.e. scaling now applies to both graphics and text).
  - TRANSLUCENCY now works with menu items and cursors
  - SCALE now works with menu items
  - COLOURMAP now works with menu items
  - HEADER.xxxx and TITLE.xxxx commands now affect graphics like "Choose Skill"
  - ENTRY_ALIGNMENT=CENTER now properly centers items
  
  

CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.33 (since EDGE-Classic 1.32)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------
+ Fixed 1.32 secret sector fix not being preserved in save games; i.e. the same secret would increment the
  secret counter when re-loading the game
+ Fixed jitter in Evil Eye and other animations
+ Fixed sprite frame overrides in DDFIMAGE not applying if they were Doom formatted images
+ Fixed SDL sound device frequency being allowed to be set far above intended values if OS doesn't report the ability
  to use 48kHz sample rate
+ Fixed Boom tagged line effects also applying the effect to the control linedef (when a tag was present)
+ Fixed Boom vector linedef scroll directions for angles other than 0/45/90
+ Fixed Boom displacement scrollers not returning back to their exact original position
+ Fixed Boom scrollers tied to permanently moving sectors (i.e., Door Open and Stay Open) being ineffective
+ Fixed inanimate objects adhering to monster dropoff limits when being carried over a drop
+ Fixed overzealous oofing when falling or bumping into a ceiling
+ Doom2 Map05 bug fixed properly this time ;)
+ Fixed some new DDFSTYLE additions (entry and cursor alignment, etc) not working as intended with the Episode Select menu

+ DDFSTYLE text styles can now have their own individual X_OFFSET and Y_OFFSET values,
  giving more flexibility for menu item placement i.e. TITLE.Y_OFFSET or TEXT.Y_OFFSET etc
  
+ Changed how LOSE_BENEFIT HEALTH is handled in RTS. Now it will simply subtract from current health and not
  behave like DAMAGE_PLAYER(which reduces armour, causes pain states, respects immunity/resistence/invulnerable/immortal etc).

+ "Crosshair Size" option in Video Options menu will now apply to both the standard crosshair and custom weapon crosshair states
  (previously this only affected standard crosshairs)
  
+ Monsters resurrected by Archviles will no longer count as kills.

+ Replaced WebSID SID backend with cRSID for easier compilation and better performance

+ Things no longer constantly trigger splashes when walking on a flat defined as LIQUID (and having an IMPACT_OBJECT defined). 
  They will only cause a splash when they step down onto the flat.

+ Migrated from libXMP to Mod4Play (custom library) for portability/performance
  - Only the "Big 4" tracker formats are supported now (IT/S3M/XM/MOD)

+ Upgraded to AJBSP 1.04

+ Added support for ZGL3 compressed lumps to AJBSP and EDGE-Classic's node loading routines to conserve cache folder space. ZGL3 will now
  be the default node format.

New Features
------------
+ Added support for MDL (Quake 1) model format

+ Added support for KVX and KV6 voxel model formats

+ Ported MD3 model support from EDGE 1.32 codebase

+ DDFTHING:
  - New command: FALLPAIN_SOUND, which is the sfx to be played when the player is hurt from a big fall
  - New command: MODEL_ROTATE = <integer>, which for MDL/MD2/MD3/Voxels will rotate all vertices' x/y coordinates by the
    given (positive or negative) number of degrees. Used to correct imported models whose rotations are wrong. Default is 0.

+ DDFIMAGE:
  - New command: ROTATE_HUE = <integer>, will rotate the hue of the given image while keeping other values the same. Valid range is -1800
    to 1800, with a default of 0.

+ COAL:
  - C++ Interop: Can now retrieve and set individual vector elements with the VM_GetVectorX/Y/Z and VM_SetVectorX/Y/Z functions

  style entry (if defined)

+ DDFSTYLE: CURSOR.FORCE_OFFSETS=<boolean> - When set to true, will honor cursor image's offsets even if they cause misalignment with
  menu entries. Default value is false

+ Added simplified R_PointToAngle and angle calculation constants from usernameAK (backported from EDGE 2.x)

+ Added some rearranged sky and unit drawing functions from dpjudas (backported from EDGE 2.x)

New Features
------------
+ COALHUDS: new commands
  -hud.rts_isactive(tag): Returns 1 if the script "tag" is currently enabled, 0 if disabled.
  -hud.rts_enable(name): Will execute RTS script with matching tag, if one exists. This replaces previous COAL command "player.rts_enable_tagged(name)" which should be considered deprecated.

+ DDFSTYLE: new text style - SELECTED
  - Uses all parameters that regular style font entries use (SELECTED.FONT, SELECTED.SCALE, etc)
  - Will only apply to the currently selected/highlighted menu item
  - If not defined, will fall back to previous behavior for backwards compatibility

+ Vertical offset scrolling will now work with midmask textures. Midmaskers without vertical scrolling
  will remain clamped per the existing implementation
+ Freedoom Phase 1 and 2 have their own base WAD, which provides corrected text and menu graphics
+ Added capturing of console content (if active) in screenshots
+ Number of available AMMO and INVENTORY types increased to 99
+ Widescreen ratio resolutions added to windowed resolution list
+ DOOMWADPATH environment variable now supported
+ AJBSP updated to produce only XGL3 nodes compatible with both binary/UDMF map formats
  - XGL3 node writing adapted from Eureka codebase with vertex comparison improvements from ketmar/k8vavoom
  - XGL3 node loading functions adapted from EDGE 2.x
+ GWA file will always be built, regardless of a WAD having internal GL lumps
  - This prevents crashes with malformed/orphaned GL lumps in a WAD
+ IWADs are now detected by combinations of unique lumps instead of simple filenames
+ Improved handling of PWADs with custom status bars that aren't widescreen
+ Improved height clipping for non-blocking map objects
+ New graphical startup sequence
+ Axis Test added to Mouse/Joystick control options menu to assist in mapping thumbsticks/analog triggers
+ Widescreen status bar extenders added for Freedoom 1/2, Heretic, and Blasphemer
+ Alternate liquid animations now apply when relevant graphics are used in HUD drawing functions (intermissions, etc)
+ Console dir/ls commands with just a mask for a parameter will search the current directory instead of requiring an explicit directory path
+ IDCLEV/warp will now work with non-standard map names
+ Slider options in the Option menu will be drawn with font symbols if an IMAGE DDFFONT type is in use (patch fonts will use the existing slider graphics)
+ Console will automatically scroll back to the bottom/input line after inputting a command
+ Level stat screens will how fallback to HUD fonts if certain images are missing ("Kills", "Items", etc)
+ DDFSTYLE: AUTOMAP background images/colors will now be used when drawing the automap if defined

New Features
------------
+ DP* sound lumps (PC speaker sounds) in the DOOM IWADs are now usable via DDFSFX

+ "PC Speaker Mode" option added to Sound Options menu. Only specific SFX will be used, and
  the MIDI player will switch to an appropriate soundfont
  -Imitation PC Speaker sounds added for Blasphemer, Heretic, and HacX

+ "Pistol Starts" option added to Gameplay Options menu (default Off). Will force player to default state upon
  starting a new level. Works with all supported IWADs

+ COALHUDS: new commands/variables
  -player.rts_enable_tagged(name): Will execute RTS script with matching tag, if one exists
  -hud.scroll_image(x, y, name, sx, sy, [noOffset]): will scroll an image in horizontal and/or vertical directions
  -hud.get_average_color(name): Will return an RGB vector with the average color of the named image lump
  -hud.get_average_top_border_color(name): Will return an RGB vector with the average top border color of the named image lump
  -hud.get_average_bottom_border_color(name): Will return an RGB vector with the average bottom border color of the named image lump
  -hud.get_lightest_color(name): Will return an RGB vector with the lightest color of the named image lump
  -hud.get_darkest_color(name): Will return an RGB vector with the darkest color of the named image lump
  -hud.get_average_hue(name): Will return an RGB vector with the average hue of the named image lump
  -hud.universal_y_adjust variable: Will apply a Y_ADJUST of this value to all weapon sprites
  
+ COALHUDS: modified commands
  -hud.draw_image(x, y, name, [noOffset]) has a new optional [noOffset] parameter which if set to 1, will ignore any X or Y offsets the image may have, both doom style and any defined in images.ddf
  -hud.stretch_image(x, y, w, h, name, [noOffset]) has a new optional [noOffset] parameter which if set to 1, will ignore any X or Y offsets the image may have, both doom style and any defined in images.ddf
  -hud.draw_text(x, y, str, [size]) has a new optional [size] argument to set the font size in pixels i.e. 16
  -hud.draw_num2(x, y, len, num, [size]) has a new optional [size] argument to set the font size in pixels i.e. 16
  -hud.draw_number(x, y, len, num, align_right, [size]) has a new optional [size] argument to set the font size in pixels i.e. 16
  
+ FONTS.DDF
  -New font type: IMAGE; an image with a 16x16 ASCII character layout with either a transparent or solid color background
  --Examples can be found at https://bmf.php5.cz/, https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Tileset_repository, and other sites that use spritesheet or bitmap fonts
  --Images can also be generated from TrueType fonts using https://lucide.github.io/Font-Atlas-Generator/
  --Required parameter: "IMAGE = <string>", which should refer to a DDFIMAGE definition of the image in question
  --Optional parameter: "SPACING = <int>", accepts positive or negative values to have fine-grain control over horizontal spacing of letters

+ IMAGES.DDF
  -New special: "IS_FONT = <bool>", needed when using an image in conjunction with the new IMAGE DDFFONT type. Will automatically set the background to transparent
   (if it isn't already), as well as apply the required mip/clamping flags to the texture
  -IMAGE_DATA command: 'DOOM' format can now be specified in addition to the already existing PNG/JPG/TGA formats

+ WEAPONS.DDF
  -Command: RENDER_INVERT=TRUE which will cause this weapon to render the sprites in reverse order
   i.e. Crosshair, flash, weapon. Mainly useful for not having to "cut out" the shape of the weapon
   muzzle from flash sprites. Also good for MD2 models so that the flash sprites are obscured
   by the weapon model
  -Command: Y_ADJUST=<number> which will offset the weapon sprites in Y
  (negative numbers move it down, positive numbers move it up). Mainly for Heretic compatibility
  -State Action: BECOME(<weapon name>,<state:frame>) Similar to the things.ddf action of the same 
   name.<state:frame> is optional
  -Command: ZOOM_FACTOR=<float> which will function as a traditional zoom magnification factor (1.5, 2.0, etc)
   and will be preferred over ZOOM_FOV if both are present
  -Command: NO_CHEAT=<bool> will prevent the weapon from being given to the player when using idkfa/idfa style cheats

+ SFX.DDF
  -Command: PC_SPEAKER_LUMP = <lumpname>; optional, specifies an alternate lump to use when in PC Speaker Mode

+ STYLES.DDF
  -PRE and END level texts now use style defined in entry [INTERLEVEL_TEXT] 
  
+ LEVELS.DDF
  -Command: LEAVING_BACKGROUND = <graphic>
  -Command: ENTERING_BACKGROUND = <graphic>  
  which can be used to override the intermission background defined in games.ddf on a per level basis.
  
+ THINGS.DDF
  -New SPECIAL: NO_TRIGGER_LINES which is similar to the same SPECIAL in attacks.ddf. Monsters flagged with 
   this special cannot activate special lines i.e. doors etc.
  -New SPECIAL: SHOVEABLE. If we push up against this thing then we can move it around. Mainly for
   Heretics pods.
  -New SPECIAL: NO_SPLASH. This thing causes no effects (i.e water splashes) on a floor defined in DDFFLAT as having an IMPACT_OBJECT  
  -KILL_BENEFIT: Will grant player benefits if they kill the mobj in question (does not apply when using KILLALL or similar cheats)
  -New ACTION: PLAYSOUND_BOSS(sfx) which will play the sound at full volume regardless of ALWAYS_LOUD flag

+ RTS: new commands
  -REPLACE_WEAPON <OldWeapon> <NewWeapon> which will replace one weapon with another instantly(no up/down states run) 
   if the player has it. It doesn't matter if we have the old one currently selected or not. Mainly for Heretic compatibility
  -WEAPON_EVENT <weapon> <label> which is similar to THING_EVENT: If we have the weapon we 
   insta-switch to it and go to the STATE we indicated
   
+ New Benefit Type: COUNTER01-COUNTER99. The idea behind this is to be able to store arbitrary values across savegames, for things
  like LIVES, SCORE, EXPERIENCE etc. To reflect this (and for convenience) the first 4 COUNTERS can be referenced like this:
	LIVES or COUNTER01
	SCORE or COUNTER02
	MONEY or COUNTER03
	EXPERIENCE or COUNTER04
  In DDF COUNTERs are usable as PICKUP_BENEFIT options; syntax is the same as giving ammo
  In RTS COUNTERs are usable for various commands; syntax is the same as for ammo i.e. ON_CONDITION COUNTER01(3)
  In COAL: 
	+ player.counter(counter_num) returns the value of the COUNTER
	+ player.set_counter(counter_num, value) allows us to change a COUNTER value

+ Partial UMAPINFO support
  - The following UMAPINFO keys are recognized:
  -- levelpic
  -- skytexture
  -- levelname
  -- music
  -- nextmap
  -- nextsecret
  -- exitpic
  -- enterpic
  -- endpic
  -- dobunny
  -- docast
  -- endgame
  -- interbackdrop
  -- intermusic
  -- intertextsecret
  -- partime

+ UDMF 1.1 Support
  - TEXTMAP parser adapted from EDGE 2.x
  - The following UDMF namespaces are currently supported:
  -- Doom
  -- Heretic
  -- ZDoomTranslated  
  
+ Heretic/Blasphemer support: vastly improved. Now 100% completeable from start to finish.

+ Console: clear/cls commands added to clear the current set of console lines (this does not clear the command history)

+ ENDOOM Support
  - Use the new `endoom` command in the console
  - Supports foreground/background colors and blinking
  - Supports ENDOOM, ENDTEXT, and ENDBOOM lumps


CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.1 (since EDGE-Classic 1.0)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------
+ Longstanding SWIM sector special bug fixed. EDGE would continue 
  flagging the player as being in a SWIM sector even after leaving it. 
  Happens if SWIM special is used without AIRLESS(underwater) also. 
  Most noticeable side effect was being unable to jump/crouch and bizarre momentum/speed
+ Downgraded errors for incorrect 3D extrafloors to warnings instead. 
+ E3M4 crusher bug fixed.

General Improvements
--------------------
+ RTS Scripts can now use either a number or a string for their TAGs.

+ Replaced libpng, libjpeg and image_tga.cc with stb_image.

+ Replaced zlib with miniz.

+ Consolidated some EPI filesystem functions so that platform-specific source files aren't required.

+ Compilation now works with MSVC Build Tools. SDL2 development headers/libs included for this purpose.

+ Player Crouch height reduced to 28, same as other ports.

+ Bumped up the number of sound channels: minimum 32, maximum 96.


New Features
------------
+ Added inventory system
  + Controls: Inventory Previous, Inventory Use, and Inventory Next can now be bound to keys
  + DDF: INV01-INV25 are usable as PICKUP_BENEFIT options; syntax is the same as giving ammo
  + RTS: INV01-INV25 are usable for various commands; syntax is the same as for ammo i.e. ON_CONDITION INV01(3)
  + COAL: player.inventory_events(): event-based handling for keys based on Inventory Previous, Inventory Use, and Inventory Next bindings
  + COAL/RTS:  player.use_inventory(): will call RTS script of appropriate tag when inventory item is used; naming convention for inventory script tags is INVENTORY1 - INVENTORY25

+ Heretic COALHUDS updated with game-approriate inventory display

+ Added 'autoload' folder which is scanned for valid file types on startup. Sub-folders can fine tune what is loaded for specific IWADs.

+ Added "Animated Liquid Type" to Video Options menu; choices are "Vanilla", "SMMU", "SMMU + Swirl", and "Parallax"

+ FLATS.DDF (wad lump "DDFFLAT") which can be used to associate certain sounds, objects etc. with specific flats.
  - Command: LIQUID="THIN" or "THICK" can be added to a flat definition. Currently affects swirl/dynamic liquid parameters.
  - Command: IMPACT_OBJECT=<thing> where <thing> is an entry in THINGS.DDF. When the flat is shot, the <thing> will be spawned at the impact point (e.g. for splashes from water).
  - Command: FOOTSTEP = <sound> where <sound> is an entry in SFX.DDF. Can be used via COALHUDS to make appropriate sfx when moving across this flat.

+ LINES.DDF
  - New command: EFFECT_OBJECT=<thing> where <thing> is an entry in THINGS.DDF. When the line is activated, the <thing> will be spawned in the center of the line (e.g. for sparks from a switch). If the line is of type SHOOT then we spawn the object at the spot where the shot impacts instead.(e.g. a flesh wall that spurts blood when shot).
  - New command: GLASS=TRUE which causes this line type to (a)be blocking and (b)will apply the LINE_EFFECT= specials BLOCK_SHOTS and BLOCK_SIGHT if specified.
    Once the line is activated(normally via SHOOT) then (1) line will be set to unblocking, (2)BLOCK_SHOTS and BLOCK_SIGHT will be removed, (3) the mid-texture will be removed. 
    If combined with EFFECT_OBJECT then you can spawn shards of broken glass when the line "breaks" for example. NOTE: GLASS=TRUE should be used with COUNT=1.
  - New command: BROKEN_TEXTURE=<texture> which, when combined with GLASS=TRUE, will replace the mid-texture with this one instead of just removing it i.e. for shooting out a vent and replacing it with a broken vent.

+ COALHUDS: new commands
  -player.play_footstep(flatname) checks FLATS.DDF for corresponding entry and plays the sfx associated with this flat.
  -hud.screen_aspect() returns the current screen aspect e.g. 1.0, 1.333 etc.
  -hud.AM_HIDELINES for hud.automap_option() which hides all geometry on the automap.

+ RTS: new commands
  -SWITCH_WEAPON <weapon> which will force a switch to this <weapon> if the player has it.
  -TELEPORT_TO_START which will simply teleport the player back to player 1 start.
  
+ THINGS.DDF
  -Crouching now triggers CROUCH states for the player when used with CHECK_ACTIVITY.
  -Added player crouch spites to edge-defs.wad.

+ New XMP-based music player; MOD/S3M/IT/XM Tracker format songs are now supported.

+ New Game Music Emu-based music player; AY, GBS, GYM, HES, NSF, SAP, SPC, VGM format songs are now supported.

+ New WebSID-based music player; Commodore-64 SID format songs are now supported.

+ Main menu UI by default is now text based and uses strings from language.ddf and colouring/fonts defined in styles.ddf.
  If a pwad contains custom menu graphics then they will be used instead.
  
+ New names and DDF definitions for our menu sfx so we don't have to share the same names as normal doom sfx.
  
+ 2 new custom fonts included in edge-defs.wad for use with our new dynamic menu: Verdana-style font and Doom-style.

+ MBF sky transfer linetypes 271 and 272 partially supported via new line Effect "SKY_TRANSFER".

+ Dynamic Reverb option in Sound Menu. Will attempt to reverberate all sounds based on room size and being indoor/outdoors

+ SECTORS.DDF
  -Can add specials VACUUM_SFX, SUBMERGED_SFX, and REVERB_SFX to affect sounds while in that sector
  -REVERB_SFX has additional required parameters: REVERB_TYPE="REVERB" or "ECHO", REVERB_DELAY=(any number), and REVERB_RATIO=(0-100)


CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.0 (since EDGE-Classic Preview 1)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------
- Apple compilation now works, thanks to testing and PRs from atsb/Gibbon

- Dropping the console with a movement key held down would preserve that movement while in the console. Now toggling the console properly drops (movement) input

- Games with only one selectable episode will now skip episode selection and proceed directly to the skill choice menu. This prevents the "Hell on Earth" episode from appearing when it is not appropriate

- Fixed bug with valid skybox texture references being deleted when cycling between real and pseudo-skyboxes

- Downgraded textures without patches from being an error (ending the program) to a warning

- Fixed occasional bug where attempting to bind a key would map it to the wrong command

- Fixed bug where canceling out of an RTS Menu would instead select the first option; now it should exit with no result

- Fixed player being allowed to attempt to load a game from an empty slot

- Fixed inheritance for DDFWEAP

- Sloped sectors underneath an extrafloor will now actually use their slope instead of 0 (fix backported from EDGE 2.x)


General Improvements
--------------------
+ Creating a new Save Game with a blank name will now generate a default name (gamepad users can now create new saves without a keyboard)

+ "Found Secret" message now uses DDFLANG.

+ Berserk colour tint is no longer hardcoded and can be modified via DDFCOLM.

+ Merged CeeJay's LINES DDF with ours to create the ULTIMATE LINES DDF ;)

+ Replaced GLBSP with AJBSP as EDGE-Classic's internal nodebuilder

+ doom_ddf folder content merged into edge.wad and the folder removed. The past is the future...again ;)

+ Migrated from SDL1 to SDL2 for longevity and potential new features

+ Allow for FRONT/BACK to be recognized as RIGHT/LEFT textures in the RTS CHANGE_TEX function to suit modder preferences

+ Added missing graphics for Harmony and HacX option menus (Sound, Mouse, Gameplay, etc.) so that they don't use the fallback/incorrectly
paletted Doom menu graphics

+ Improved joystick/gamepad handling; added ability to map dpad (hat) buttons and analog triggers to actions

+ Added "Menu Navigation" option in Controls to bind Menu Open/Up/Down/Left/Right/Select/Cancel

+ Added cursor to navigate RTS menus and select options in addition to using the number keys.

+ Added ability to remap functions previously hardcoded to the function keys (Quicksave, Quickload, etc)


New Features
------------
+ MP3 Sound Effects Support

+ ATTACKS.DDF:
  -New attack type: DOUBLE_SPAWNER to mimic the pain elemental in Doom64.

+ THINGS.DDF: 
  -New SPECIAL flag: FLOOR_CLIP. This things sprites will always stick to the floor in the case that it's too tall for the sector it's in.

+ More game IWADs supported: HACX, Herectic, Harmony, Blasphemer
  -HACX: Full support. Includes bug fixes and widescreen support by CeeJay. Some graphics credited to HACX 2 team.
  -Harmony: Full support. May be some (hopefully) minor differences.
  -Heretic: Partial support. Item inventory not implemented in the base engine yet.
  -Blasphemer: Rudimentary support; less thorough compared to Heretic, but IWAD will now be recognized and launch.

+ Experimental floor offset: any linetype that uses the SPECIALs "ALIGN FLOOR" or "ALIGN CEILING", if the line has texture offsets applied then EDGE will use those to offset the floor flat.

+ COALHUDS: New command
  strings.find(s,TextToFind): will find a sub-string at ANY position. Returns position it was found at or -1 if not found.

+ Added water splash sfx to EDGEs default SWIM sectors.


CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic Preview 1 (since forking from EDGE 1.35)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------
- TuttiFrutti effect. When the texture was shorter than the wall it was being applied to, the blank space was either filled with black or left invisible causing all sorts of graphical anomalies. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.

- OUCH face on the hud was using incorrect damage value.

- Face on hud never looked left because random number was never > 1.

- Linetypes [268](Monster-only Silent Teleport W1 (Boom)) and [269](Monster-only Silent Teleport WR (Boom)) were incorrectly set as PUSH instead of WALK.

- Sliding doors activated by monsters now make the appropriate SFX.

- Crash-to-desktop bug when using WEAKNESS class finally fixed.

General Improvements
--------------------
+ Added more ammotypes:  Now we have from AMMO01 to AMMO24.

+ Ignore COAL bobbing commands "cam.set_vert_bob" and "cam.set_roll_bob"

+ Lines.ddf
  -Edited all Slider doors to use BDOPN sfx.
  
+ Removed #VERSION check for both DDF and RTS. 

+ Made single option RTS MENUs respond to KEYD_JOY4 button.

+ Reduced Arachnotron width by 1. (Even though technically it is 64, this avoids issue with some pwads).

+ Reduced the lighting on several enemy attacks.

+ Default monitor ratio is set to 16:9 instead of 4:3 to accommodate most modern monitors.

+ Dynamic lighting, HQ2x, and Smoothing are now on by default to better highlight some of EDGE's rendering features.

+ Sliding doors now show on the Automap. 

+ Quietly ignore music lumps which aren't MIDI/OGG/MP3 instead of erroring out to Desktop.

+ Reduced the red tint while using the berserk power up.

+ M_SKULL1 menu cursor now uses DDFANIM (instead of being hardcoded to 2 frames). 

+ Much improved Doom skyboxes from https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=53873&hilit=doom+skyboxes

New Features
------------
+ THINGS.DDF: 
  -FALLING_SOUND for the player when they fall long distances. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.
  -SECRET_SOUND entry for the player which plays when he enters a sector marked SECRET. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch. DSSECRET SFX from K8vavoom.
  -New SPECIAL flag: IMMORTAL. This thing never recieves damage from any attacks, but will go into pain states etc as usual.

+ WEAPONS.DDF: new DJNE weapon action for more robust weapon reloading. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.
Used just like JUMP(state_name:frame,xx%), but decrements the reload quantity for the specified attack and jumps if it's not zero. The jump chance is now interpreted as the attack specifier: 0% is the primary attack ammo, and non-zero percent is the secondary attack ammo.
 
+ Lines.ddf
  -Edited all Slider doors to use BDOPN sfx.
  -Added Hub Exit switches: [2000] to [2039]
  -Added Transparent Thick Extrafloors (for glass effect): [600]Most transparent to [603]Least transparent

  [BLUE_LIGHT_CEILING:7057]
  [GREEN_LIGHT_CEILING:7058]
  [ORANGE_LIGHT_CEILING:7059]
  -Added the relevant entries for FALLING_SOUND and SECRET_SOUND to player thing.

+ Styles.ddf
  -TITLE.COLOURMAP, TITLE.SCALE and TITLE.FONT will now affect the Title in an RTS MENU (via the MENU_STYLE RTS command).
  -TEXT.COLOURMAP, TEXT.SCALE and TEXT.FONT will now affect the Options in an RTS MENU (via the MENU_STYLE RTS command).
  -BACKGROUND images are now centered and obey scaling defined either in styles.ddf or images.ddf.
  
+ RTS
  - Text TIPs now accept a 4th parameter (like TIP_GRAPHICs) which is the scaling to apply.
  - PLAYSOUND_BOSSMAN: sfx location now set on player.
  - New Command "EXIT_GAME": exits out of the map and back to the main title screen.

+ New MIDI Player
  - Timidity has been replaced by TinySoundfont, with support for *.sf2 soundfont files instead of GUS patch sets
  - A Roland Sound Canvas style default soundfont by Nando Florestan has been included (http://dev.nando.audio/pages/soundfonts.html).
Users with existing soundfonts can replace soundfont/default.sf2 with their own font if desired (must be named default.sf2; selector may be built in the future).
  - TinySoundfont is now the default music player for both Linux and Window builds. 

+ MP3 Music Support

+ Titlescreen and intermission are now Widescreen compatible with https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=67843

+ COALHUDS: 11 new commands
  player.kills() returns how many enemies killed on the current map.
  player.secrets() returns how many secrets discovered on current map.
  player.items() returns how many items picked up on the current map.
  player.map_enemies() returns total enemies on current map.
  player.map_secrets() returns total number of secrets on current map.
  player.map_items() returns total items on current map.
  player.floor_flat() returns the floor flat of the current sector we are in.
  player.sector_tag() returns the tag of the current sector we are in.
  hud.draw_number(x, y, len, num, align_right). hud.draw_num2() always 
    starts drawing the numbers from right-to-left. This new function 
    allows left-to right if we pass 0 for the align_right parameter, 
    or the usual draw_num2() right-to-left if we pass 1.
  math.random2() returns a random number between 0 and 10.
  hud.game_paused() returns 1 if the game is currently paused or 
    on the title menu screen.
