Description             : This is a GENMIDI patch for DMX for OPL2-OPL3 FM
                          synthesis. This patch aims to remedy the "weak"
                          default instruments to better match the Roland
                          Sound Canvas, most notably the SC-55 and SC-88.
                          Recommended minimum setup for no note-cuts is 
                          ZDoom 2.8.1 with MAME OPL2 emulator core, 
                          with 6 chips emulated.

* Construction *

Base                    : Stock DMX GENMIDI

Editor(s) used          : Hex Editors, OPL3 Bank Editor, Fraggle's Python

Known Bugs              : Due to the number of pseudo 4-op voices, certain 
                          notes may cut sooner than they would have using 
                          the stock patches. Most of Doom and Doom 2 play 
                          just fine. Depending on your CPU, there may be
                          skips in the sound due to buffer underrun, as 
                          this patch takes more channels than the stock
                          GENMIDI.
May Not Run With        : Recent dev builds of GZDoom have broken OPL
                          support as of this writing.
Tested With             : ZDoom 2.8.1, Chocolate Doom, Vanilla Doom, ADLMidi
